In this folder, there are 7 separate pickle (.pkl) files, one being the aggregation of all the other 6 files, and each other file belongs to one category: Press, Political, Casual, Administrative, Scientific, or Artistic.

Below is the link to the .pkl file containing the whole contents of the other categories:

The data dumped inside the .pkl files is stored inside Python Lists, each list containing exactly 50.000 items.

Additionally, in the "data_cleaner.py" file, you will find the code to replace in-text dates and numbers with <date> and <number> tokens. Remember to replace the three paths input, output, and final, to ensure the code runs properly.
